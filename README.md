## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to predict drug classifications using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains features related to patients' characteristics, and the objective is to predict the appropriate drug for each patient.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leela-Madhav/Drug-Prediction.git
   cd Drug-Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any).

## How to Use

1. Open the `notebooks/drug_prediction.ipynb` notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run code cells, preprocess data, train models, and evaluate predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (for local execution)
- Libraries mentioned in the notebook (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)

## How to Use

1. Open the `notebooks/drug_prediction.ipynb` notebook file using Google Colab:
   [Open in Colab](your-copied-link-here)
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run code cells, preprocess data, train models, and evaluate predictions.
```
